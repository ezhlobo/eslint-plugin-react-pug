[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/ezhlobo/eslint-plugin-react-pug.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Add supporting of pugjs with react.

It adds supporting of [babel-plugin-transform-react-pug](https://github.com/pugjs/babel-plugin-transform-react-pug).

## Installation

You'll first need to install [ESLint](http://eslint.org):

```
$ npm i eslint --save-dev
```

Next, install `eslint-plugin-react-pug`:

```
$ npm install eslint-plugin-react-pug --save-dev
```

**Note:** If you installed ESLint globally (using the `-g` flag) then you must also install `eslint-plugin-react-pug` globally.

## Usage

Add `react-pug` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:

```json
{
    "plugins": [
        "react-pug"
    ]
}
```

Then configure the rules you want to use under the rules section.

```json
{
    "extends": [
        "plugin:react-pug/all"
    ]
}
```

## Supported Rules

* ### `react-pug/no-undef`

  Disallow undeclared variables in Pug

  #### Rule details

  The following patterns are considered warnings:
  ```js
  pug`Hello(name="John")`
  ```

  The following patterns are not considered warnings:
  ```js
  var Hello = require('./Hello')

  ```

  ```

  The following patterns are not considered warnings:

* ### `react-pug/uses-vars`

  Prevent variables used in pugjs to be incorrectly marked as unused
